Requirements:
python (2.5+ required, 3.0+ not tested)
python-irclib (0.5.0+ required)

Install:
Copy sample_config.py to what will be the bot's working directory and rename to config.py . Edit config.py to customize your bot.

Starting the bot:
If the working directory is different from the script's use the -c option to specify the path.
Use -d to daemonize. (Not yet implemented)

Writing modules:
Just write a class that has event handler methods named "on_EVENT" where EVENT is any of the events generated by python-irclib. They are enumerated in irclib.py.
Name your class "IRCModule" or make a module member referencing your module class. (e.g. IRCModule = MyModuleClass)
Put the file in the modules directory and add the file's module name (the file name minus ".py") to the MODULES list in config.py .
